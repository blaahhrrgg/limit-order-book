# limit-order-book

This package contains various implementations of a limit order book for 
benchmarking and educational purposes. 

The implementations are in `Python` for ease of prototyping, it would 
generally be advised that "production" implementations are in a different
language.

A limit order book is a mechanism that trading venues use to record the 
interest and match buyers and sellers in a financial instrument in order to 
facilitate trade. See Gould et. al. (2013) for a comprehensive overview.
